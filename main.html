            <div class="poetry-content">
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>I pray that you may find peace that surpasses all understanding. That God may grant you strength to face all challenges with courage and resilience.<br>
                    I pray that God surrounds you with love and remind you that you are never alone, ever. May God's light shine upon your path, leading you to success, <br>happiness and fulfillment. 
                I thank God for you, for the laughter and joy you bring to my life and I pray that your days may be filled with smiles, and <br>that the warmth of God's love may surround you, all the days of your life.

                <br>
                <br>
                I pray that you may always remember that everything is possible with God, and that you may always have faith in His plans for you. I pray that you<br> may always be guided by His wisdom and that you may always be protected by His grace.
                I pray that during the difficult times, you may always find <br>comfort in God's love. That you may remember that you've got this, and that you are stronger than you think. 
                I pray that you may allow me,<br> and everyone else in your circle to love you like God intended, that you may allow us to extend the same grace that you have always extended to us.
                    
                <br>
                <br>
                I pray that when the darkness gets loud, you may always remember that you are the light. THE SUNSHINE!!! That when the voices become too loud<br> to bear, you may remember that you are loved, and that you are worthy of love.
                I pray to God that you may always remember that you are enough,<br> that you are more than enough, that you are everything and more. That you are a masterpiece, a work of art, a gift to the world, a gift to me.
                I pray<br> that as you begin this new chapter in your life, this big ass age, that you will remember that it's never that serious.
                <br>
                <br>
                I pray all of this in the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Amen. ‚ô•Ô∏è

                <b>Gravity</b>
                <br>
                <br>


                We're friends right?<br>
                Yet my pulse quickens at the sound<br>
                Of my name in your voice<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                Your words fall like autumn leaves<br>
                Heavy with meaning I dare not collect<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                I search those eyes of yours<br>
                Browner than soil after rain<br>
                For answers you may not know you hold<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                Our fingers meet in passing<br>
                Accident or intention?<br>
                The question burns between us<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                That laugh of yours cracks open the air<br>
                Your smile unfolds like a secret<br>
                I want to keep<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                As if the universe conspired<br>
                To place you in my path<br>
                Each detail of you I collect silently<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                You've become the missing piece<br>
                The breath I need<br>
                The horizon I face<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                But in the quiet moments<br>
                When truth hangs suspended<br>
                I wonder if you too<br>
                Feel this gravity between us<br>
            </p>

                    Another year around the sun,<br>
                    My love-<br>
                    Your birthday marks not just your time,<br>
                    But all the ways you've touched my life.<br>
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Remember when the shadows fell,<br>
                    And words were hard to find?<br>
                    You sat beside me in the dark,<br>
                    Two silhouettes defined.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Today is yours‚Äîthe light, the cake,<br>
                    The wishes whispered true.<br>
                    But I want you to carry this:<br>
                    Some promises don't fade or rust.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    When winter comes again, as it might,<br>
                    When stars refuse to glow, as they might,<br>
                    When the world gets cold and dark, as it might,<br>
                    My shoulder hasn't changed its height,<br>
                    My door, its open stance.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Your laughter is a gift I treasure,<br>
                    Your tears I help to dry.<br>
                    In celebration, in sorrow,<br>
                    Us? We stand the test of time.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    So as you celebrate this day,<br>
                    There's something I can't quite say.<br>
                    But know each star I wish upon<br>
                    Carries your name from dusk till dawn.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    So blow your candles, make your wish,<br>
                    Embrace this brand new year.<br>
                    And know that whether storm or sun,<br>
                    I'm standing right here.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
